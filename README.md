# Cryptocurrency price tracking app

This app uses localstorage and React states in order to display the price of Bitcoin the last time the user visited the app. Additionally, there is a chart with price and market information for BTC, ETH, XMR, BCH and ZEC which are averages across 31 exchanges. 

Deployed: https://btclast.herokuapp.com/

Future development: Allow the user to locally store price information for all 5 pre-tracked currencies. In addition to allowing the user to select their own cryptocurrencies to track.
